/**
 * Some breaking changes in version 0.7 - changed interface from using
 * [ErrorListener]s to [Stream]s. Events can now be listened to with greater
 * specificity, and more appropriately named. The following [Stream]s can now
 * be listened to:
 *   [Stream]<[SyntaxError]>[onSyntaxError],
 *   [Stream]<[AmbiguityEvent]>[onAmbiguity],
 *   [Stream]<[AttemptingFullContextEvent]>[onAttemptingFullContext], and
 *   [Stream]<[ContextSensitivityEvent]>[onContextSensitivity].
 *
 *
 * To fix broken code:
 *
 * Old broken code:
 *     recognizer.addErrorListener(errorListener);
 *     // do stuff;
 *     recognizer.removeErrorListener(errorListener);
 *
 * Fix:
 *     var subscription = recognizer.onSyntaxError.listen((e)
 *         => doSomethingWith(e));
 *     // do stuff;
 *     subscription.cancel();
 *
 * Note if errorListener in the above code block has non-trivial implementations
 * of other functions e.g. reportContextSensitivity, these will have to be
 * subscribed to separately.
 *
 * Alternatively, you may extend Recognizer with [DeprecatedRecognizerMixin]
 * from antlr4dart._deprecation_fix.dart for an immediate fix. This isn't
 * advised, as it uses deprecated features that will be removed in future, but
 * may be a sufficient quick-fix for projects with a large code-base solution.
 *
 * Also note as of version 0.7, syntaxerrors are no longer automatically
 * [print]ed - you must subscribe if this is what you want:
 *     recognizer.onSyntaxError.listen(print);
